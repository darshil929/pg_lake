-- Upgrade script for pg_lake_iceberg from 3.3 to 3.4

/*
 * iceberg_catalog foreign data wrapper: allows defining named catalog
 * configurations via CREATE SERVER so that users are not limited to a
 * single global REST catalog configured through GUC settings.
 *
 * Server options (non-secret): rest_endpoint, rest_auth_type,
 *   oauth_endpoint, scope, enable_vended_credentials, location_prefix,
 *   catalog_name.
 * User mapping options (credentials): client_id, client_secret, scope.
 *
 * scope is accepted in both server and user mapping; user mapping wins.
 *
 * Credential resolution depends on the catalog kind:
 *
 *   - The built-in 'rest' catalog reads credentials from the
 *     pg_lake_iceberg.rest_catalog_client_id /
 *     pg_lake_iceberg.rest_catalog_client_secret GUCs.
 *   - User-created catalog servers require credentials on a USER
 *     MAPPING.  They do NOT fall back to the GUCs above, so that a
 *     role with USAGE on the FDW cannot create a server pointing at
 *     a third-party endpoint and harvest the system-wide credentials.
 *
 * User-defined catalog example:
 *   CREATE SERVER my_polaris TYPE 'rest'
 *     FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER iceberg_catalog
 *     OPTIONS (rest_endpoint 'https://polaris.example.com');
 *
 *   CREATE USER MAPPING FOR user1 SERVER my_polaris
 *     OPTIONS (client_id '...', client_secret '...');
 *
 *   CREATE TABLE t (a int) USING iceberg WITH (catalog = 'my_polaris');

/*
 * Built-in catalog servers.
 *
 * These three servers are pre-created as structural anchors for the
 * pg_depend dependency edges that iceberg tables record against their
 * catalog server.  They are extension-owned and immutable: ALTER, DROP,
 * RENAME, and OWNER changes on them are all blocked.  Configuration
 * for the built-in catalogs lives in GUCs, not in server options.
 *
 * Users keep typing the short names ('postgres', 'object_store', 'rest')
 * as the catalog= option value on CREATE TABLE; ResolveCatalogServerName
 * maps short -> long at server lookup time.  The long names are prefixed
 * so they cannot collide with names users may already have in their
 * databases (e.g. a postgres_fdw server literally named 'postgres').
 *
 * Pre-flight: error early with a clear hint if any of the long names is
 * already in use.  This prevents a confusing "server already exists"
 * mid-upgrade.
