# string_agg(text, text) is pushed down to pgduck_server / DuckDB only when the
# delimiter is a non-NULL constant.  With that guarantee every other behavior
# (NULL/empty values, ORDER BY, DISTINCT, FILTER, GROUP BY) is identical between
# PostgreSQL and DuckDB.
#
# IMPORTANT: string_agg without an ORDER BY has an unspecified concatenation
# order, which legitimately differs between local (PostgreSQL) and pushed-down
# (DuckDB) execution.  Every parity case below therefore uses an ORDER BY inside
# the aggregate so the comparison against the heap table is deterministic.

# Cases that must be pushed down and must match the heap table.
